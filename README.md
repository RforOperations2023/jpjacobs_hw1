## Geoffrey's preferences
- Use the style guide Geoffrey linked
  - It's a Stanford webpage, I'm pretty sure
- Make a commit each time I finish a chunk.
  - So like, >5 commits overall
- It's gotta work on `shinyapps`, lol
- For scaling ggplots, consider using the `scales` library
  - Title-case labels, clear style
  - Geoffrey likes commas for thousand separators.
- Email Geoffrey w/ link to this repo, and a link to the app on shinyapps.io
